# CVE-2025-65647: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Track Order Function of PHPGURUKUL Online Shopping Portal v2.1

---

*Description*

An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the Track Order functionality of PHPGURUKUL Online Shopping Portal v2.1. The vulnerability in `track-order.php` allows attackers to manipulate the `oid` (order ID) parameter to access order details belonging to other users without proper authorization checks. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive customer information including order details, personal data, and transaction history.

---

*Steps to Reproduce (PoC)*

1. Register and log in as a legitimate user on the Online Shopping Portal.
2. Navigate to any category and place an order on an item.
3. On the order history page click on the track button on the item.
4. Copy the url and open on another tab and change the value of `oid` parameter.
5. Observe that the order details of other users are visible.

---

*Impact*

This IDOR vulnerability enables attackers to access sensitive order information of all users in the system, enumerate valid order IDs and extract customer data, compromise user privacy and confidentiality, and potentially leverage disclosed information for social engineering or further attacks.

---

*Mitigation*

Implement proper authorization checks to verify that users can only access their own orders. Use indirect object references (e.g., session-based mapping instead of direct database IDs). Validate user ownership of the requested resource before displaying sensitive data. Implement access control lists (ACLs) and enforce least privilege principles. Consider using UUIDs or encrypted identifiers instead of sequential order IDs.
